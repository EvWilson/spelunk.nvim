# spelunk.nvim

Marks not cutting it? Create and manage bookmarks more easily, with an easy to use and configurable UI.

![Demo](assets/demo.gif)

## Design Goals
Programming often involves navigating between similar points of interest. Additionally, layers of functionality are often composed together, and thus are often read and edited as part of a stack. `spelunk.nvim` leans into this mental model to allow you to manage bookmarks as related stacks.

`spelunk.nvim` also seeks to take an opinionated approach to configuration. Default keymaps are provided to give the full experience out of the box, as opposed to a build-your-own, API-centric approach. API documentation is provided for those who would prefer to customize their experience.

## Features
- Capture and manage bookmarks as stacks of line number locations
- Opt-in persistence of bookmarks on a per-directory basis
- Togglable UI, with contextual and rebindable controls
	- Can also customize layout and panel rendering
- Cycle bookmarks via keybind
- Jump directly to bookmark by index
- Telescope integration - fuzzy find over bookmarks and stacks
- Lualine integration - show the number of bookmarks in the current buffer
- Sign column index display
- Mark aliases
- Treesitter integration - optionally show grammar context
- Opt-in git branch persistence scoping

See the `faqs/` directory for more custom setup guides.

## Requirements
Neovim (**stable** only) >= 0.11.0

## Installation/Configuration
Via [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):
```lua
require('lazy').setup({
	{
		'EvWilson/spelunk.nvim',
		dependencies = {
			'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',           -- For window drawing utilities
			'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',   -- Optional: for fuzzy search capabilities
			'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', -- Optional: for showing grammar context
		},
		config = function()
			require('spelunk').setup({
				enable_persist = true
			})
		end
	}
})
```

Want to configure more keybinds? Pass a config object to the setup function.
Here's the default mapping object for reference:
```lua
{
	base_mappings = {
		-- Toggle the UI open/closed
		toggle = '<leader>bt',
		-- Add a bookmark to the current stack
		add = '<leader>ba',
		-- Move to the next bookmark in the stack
		next_bookmark = '<leader>bn',
		-- Move to the previous bookmark in the stack
		prev_bookmark = '<leader>bp',
		-- Fuzzy-find all bookmarks
		search_bookmarks = '<leader>bf',
		-- Fuzzy-find bookmarks in current stack
		search_current_bookmarks = '<leader>bc',
		-- Fuzzy find all stacks
		search_stacks = '<leader>bs',
	},
	window_mappings = {
		-- Move the UI cursor down
		cursor_down = 'j',
		-- Move the UI cursor up
		cursor_up = 'k',
		-- Move the current bookmark down in the stack
		bookmark_down = '<C-j>',
		-- Move the current bookmark up in the stack
		bookmark_up = '<C-k>',
		-- Jump to the selected bookmark
		goto_bookmark = '<CR>',
		-- Jump to the selected bookmark in a new vertical split
		goto_bookmark_hsplit = 'x',
		-- Jump to the selected bookmark in a new horizontal split
		goto_bookmark_vsplit = 'v',
		-- Delete the selected bookmark
		delete_bookmark = 'd',
		-- Navigate to the next stack
		next_stack = '<Tab>',
		-- Navigate to the previous stack
		previous_stack = '<S-Tab>',
		-- Create a new stack
		new_stack = 'n',
		-- Delete the current stack
		delete_stack = 'D',
		-- Rename the current stack
		edit_stack = 'E',
		-- Close the UI
		close = 'q',
		-- Open the help menu
		help = 'h',
	},
	-- Flag to enable directory-scoped bookmark persistence
	enable_persist = false,
	-- Prefix for the Lualine integration
	-- (Change this if your terminal emulator lacks emoji support)
	statusline_prefix = '🔖',
	-- Set UI orientation
	-- Type: 'vertical' | 'horizontal' | LayoutProvider
	-- Advanced customization: you may set your own layout provider for fine-grained control over layout
	-- See `layout.lua` for guidance on setting this up
	orientation = 'vertical',
	-- Enable to show mark index in status column
	enable_status_col_display = false,
	-- The character rendered before the currently selected bookmark in the UI
	cursor_character = '>',
	-- Set whether or not to persist bookmarks per git branch
	persist_by_git_branch = false,
}
```

Want to not set a keybind for a given action? Set the bound value to `'NONE'` and it will skip being set.
Keybinds can be set to either individual strings or arrays of strings, so for example `window_mappings.cursor_down` above could be mapped to `{ 'j', '<leader>s' }`.

Check the mentioned help screen to see current keybinds and their use:

### Lualine integration
A default integration with [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) is provided to show the number of active bookmarks in the current buffer. You may override the prefix for this string in the config map above. The result of the provided configuration here can be seen in the demo video above, in the bottom left of the screen.
```lua
  {
    'nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim',
    config = function()
      require('lualine').setup {
        sections = {
          lualine_b = { 'spelunk' },
	  -- Or, added to the default lualine_b config from here: https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#default-configuration
          -- lualine_b = { 'branch', 'diff', 'diagnostics', 'spelunk' },
        },
      }
    end
  },

```

## API Documentation
Here be dragons! This plugin is designed with the default bindings in mind, so there is potential for misuse here. This list will be non-exhaustive to cover just the most useful available functions, with the least potential for sharp edges.

```lua
require('spelunk').setup(opts)

### API Questions?
Some examples are available in th [`faqs`](faqs/) directory. If there's something you'd like to know how to do, please open an issue and we can see about implementing it!

Currently there are guides on:
- Providing a custom formatter for display filenames
- Overriding the display function altogether to show Treesitter context instead of mark location
- Not rendering the preview UI pane, which applies to all UI panes
- Setting custom aliases for marks
